## Motley Fool Developer Interview Project
To create a virtual environment, install dependencies, run tests, and 
start the development server, run:

```
./start.sh
```
Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.

The tests can also be run separately with:
```
python3 manage.py test
```
